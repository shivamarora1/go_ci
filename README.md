# Go CI checks
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration is verified by an **automated build** and **automated tests**. 

In this repository, I have tried to cover those **checks** and **verifications** which will be performed during **integration** or **deployment** of Go code.

I am using **Gitub actions** to perform these checks. Checks are performed on Go code whenever some event is occurred like *push* or *pull request* to main repository.
